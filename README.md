## Part 1: Introduction to Precision Medicine

##### Precision medicine is “an emerging approach for disease treatment and prevention that takes into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle for each person,” according to NIH. That is to say, precision medicine is a form of specific therapeutics tailored for each patient through the use of tools such as pharmacogenomics; an offspring of pharmacogenetics. 
##### In other words, the precision medicine aims to customize health care so that each treatment is tailored for every individual in every possible way and our main focus is Pharmacogenomics with an emphasis on the genomic aspect. 


## Part 2: A Brief History  on Pharmacogenetics & Pharmacogenomics

#### To be able to understand how pharmacogenomics came to be, we must first introduce Pharmacogenetics, a science that was recognized in the late 1950s which was dependent on “ the occurrence of unusual reactions to drugs on the basis of biochemical individuality.”  *1Revolving around studies that focus on “many different genetic changes of the enzyme that altered its functional characteristics”. It later became clear that drug effects tend to differentiate not only between populations, genders, and races but also between individuals. Drug metabolism also differs between individuals due to polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes leading to variability in the effectiveness of drugs. For example, some metabolizers may absorb more of a specific drug than others across individuals, leading some of the drugs as well as some doses to be ineffective or inefficient to specific individuals. 
#### These findings were the building blocks of what we know today as Pharmacogenomics; the application of genomic technologies to drugs in clinical development. “ Pharmacogenomics exists a the intersection of pharmacology and genomics”*2, taking into consideration the “drug-metabolism phenotypes” of patients to better design drugs, drug combinations, and dosages for individual patients. Pharmacogenomic investigations require an increased use of methods designed to study many genes or gene patterns, that is to look simultaneously at the structure and expression of whole sets of genes. Such methods include high throughput sequencing technologies such as MALDI mass spectrometry, SAGE,  microarrays, linkage and haplotype analysis

## Part 3: Applications of Bioinformatic tools: RNA-Seq

*Identifying genetic factors excluding people from conventional medicine*

#### The presence of an abnormal gene can lead to a line of descendants exhibiting sensitivity towards drugs that are otherwise beneficial to those bearing the same illness. The naive way, is to commission a control and treatment group so that sensitivity can be evaluated. However, it is not only a costly procedure but also unethical in cases where the illness necessitates drastic treatments like chemotherapy, which harms both healthy and ill individuals alike.

#### Instead, researchers utilized subjects who provided consent as well as a completed a survey to provide biographical information latter used to present phenotypic classification for the data. The subjects also provided saliva samples that were used to gather data about single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs). Through this, genome-wide association studies(GWAS) was able to analyze each class’s SNPs. The latter proves useful for genome-wide association studies(GWAS) that’ll analyze each class’s SNPs. The data from these GWAS can be subjected through association tests with logical regression that’ll produce a p-value determining significance. Small p values indicated that these patients are inheritors of unique markers or conditions that affect their ability to get regular medicine(Qs Li). The presence of these unique markers inform medical providers to select a more precise treatment for patients. 

#### Another example of genome-wide studies revealing problematic SNPs is a study by the SEARCH study collaborative group, who discovered that the rs4363657 SNP brought muscular degeneration to those who consumed statins, a drug known to treat hypertension. The group extracted DNA from their subjects and stained them so they’d fluoresce, amplified them with gel electrophoresis, and elongated them with PCR. Using a BeadChip to collect SNPs, they initiated single-SNP analysis and outed the troublesome polymorphism (SEARCH). 

*Connecting RNA-Seq* 
#### As previously discussed in regards to the naive approach, testing for drug sensitivity experimentally can be both costly and invasive to patients. However, with the advancement of high throughput sequencing, it has become possible to assess phenotypic reactions to treatment at a lower cost while obtaining more information on a molecular level. This allows researchers to have a better understanding of how gene expression differs between subpopulations who have different sensitivity to a given drug. Thus, RNA-Seq equips researchers to evaluate the complexities of drug responses through transcriptome data of  populations. RNA-seq can better advance pharmacogenomics since it connects drug sensitivity to gene expression which is crucial to the development of  more effective therapies.
